Now, you need to create a new Logic app:

1. Click on the **+ New** button at the bottom-left of the screen, expand **Web + Mobile**, then click **Logic App**. 

   This displays the Create logic app blade, where you provide some basic settings to get started.

2. In **Name** type a meaningful name for your logic app.

3. Choose the **App service plan** you used when creating your connectors. This should automatically choose the Location, Subscription and Resource Group for you.

This takes care of the basic settings, but don't click **Create** just yet. Next, you will add triggers and actions to your workflow.
